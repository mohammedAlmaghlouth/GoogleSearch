# GoogleSearch

This is a front-end project that aims to create a clone of Google's search interface, including Google Image Search and Google Advanced Search, using HTML and CSS. The project allows users to enter search queries and view search results in a format similar to Google's search results page.

## Specification
The website should meet the following requirements:

Three Pages: The website should have at least three pages: one for regular Google Search (named index.html), one for Google Image Search, and one for Google Advanced Search. <br />
Navigation Links: On the Google Search page, there should be links in the upper-right corner of the page to go to Image Search or Advanced Search. On each of the other two pages, there should be a link in the upper-right corner to go back to Google Search.<br />
Search Functionality: On the Google Search page, users should be able to type in a query, click the "Google Search" button, and be taken to the Google search results page for that query.<br />
Search Bar Design: The search bar on all pages should be centered with rounded corners, similar to Google's design. The search button should also be centered beneath the search bar.<br />
Image Search Functionality: On the Google Image Search page, users should be able to type in a query, click a search button, and be taken to the Google Image search results page for that query.<br />
Advanced Search Functionality: On the Google Advanced Search page, users should be able to provide input for four fields: "all these words", "this exact word or phrase", "any of these words", and "none of these words". The functionality should be similar to Google's own Advanced Search options.
Advanced Search Design: The four options on the Google Advanced Search page should be styled similar to Google's design.<br />

## How to use

Open the index.html file in a web browser to access the Google Search page. <br />
Enter a search query in the search bar and click the "Google Search" button to view search results. <br />
Click on the links in the upper-right corner to navigate to Google Image Search or Google Advanced Search pages. <br />
On the Google Image Search and Google Advanced Search pages, enter search queries or input for advanced search options, respectively, and click the search buttons to view image search results or perform advanced searches. <br />
