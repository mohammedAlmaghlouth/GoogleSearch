# GoogleSearch

This is a front-end project that aims to create a clone of Google's search interface, including Google Image Search and Google Advanced Search, using HTML and CSS. The project allows users to enter search queries and view search results in a format similar to Google's search results page.

## How to use

Open the index.html file in a web browser to access the Google Search page. <br />
Enter a search query in the search bar and click the "Google Search" button to view search results. <br />
Click on the links in the upper-right corner to navigate to Google Image Search or Google Advanced Search pages. <br />
On the Google Image Search and Google Advanced Search pages, enter search queries or input for advanced search options, respectively, and click the search buttons to view image search results or perform advanced searches. <br />
